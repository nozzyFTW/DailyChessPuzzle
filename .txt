Students apply iterative project techniques to independently identify, deconstruct, and solve a problem of interest by creating and evaluating a digital solution or prototype. Student individual products could:

 - educate or inform a target audience of information on a particular issue;
 - educate a target audience of information on a particular subject of interest;
 - bring awareness to a local issue.
Students will need to be mindful of any ethical considerations related to their project, if applicable.
